#### Rust is a system-level programming language.

"[Rust] deals with low-level details of memory management, data representation, and concurrency."

"... the language is designed to guide you naturally towards reliable code that is efficient in terms of speed and memory usage. [Source: Rust docs]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/foreword.html

The main tooling within the Rust ecosystem is:

`rustc` - The compiler which takes your Rust code and compiles it into binary (machine readable code)

`rustup` - The command line utility to install and update Rust

`cargo` - The Rust build system and package manager
